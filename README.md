# Monarch Butterfly Optimization

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques are based on leveraging the global behavior of a particle cloud to find optimized conditions for a given problem/function. The Monarch Butterfly Optimization (MBO) technique falls in the meta-heuristic algorithms subset of PSOs and has been shown to outperform similar optimization methods such as ABC, ACO, BBO, DE, MBO, and SGA. This is the Python 3.7 implementation of the algorithm which can be found in the article by Gai-Ge Wang [1].
